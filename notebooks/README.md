The Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) notebook is responsible for:

- Loading raw data files from the raw directory.
- Cleaning and preprocessing the data (handling missing values, correcting data types, removing duplicates, etc.).
- Generating summary statistics and visualizations to understand data distributions, relationships, and potential outliers.
- Identifying important features and patterns relevant to credit risk prediction.
- Saving the cleaned and processed datasets to the processed directory for use in modeling and further analysis.
