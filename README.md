Certainly! Here’s a clearer rewrite of your README setup instructions, excluding the "Credit Scoring Business Understanding" section:

## Project Setup

1. **Create a virtual environment**  
   Run the following command in your project root directory:
   ```
   python -m venv .venv
   ```

2. **Activate the virtual environment**  
   On Linux/macOS:
   ```
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```
   On Windows:
   ```
   .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**  
   Make sure you have a `requirements.txt` file in your project root, then run:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up the data directories**  
   - Create a data folder in the project root.
   - Inside data, create two subfolders: `raw` and `processed`.
     ```
     mkdir -p data/raw data/processed
     ```
   - Place your raw, unprocessed data files inside the `data/raw` folder.
   - The `data/processed` folder will be used to store results from exploratory data analysis (EDA) and processed datasets.

5. **Run the EDA notebook**  
   - Open the EDA notebook (e.g., `notebooks/eda.ipynb`) in Jupyter or VS Code.
   - Run the notebook to process the raw data. The processed outputs will be saved in the `data/processed` folder.

---   - Place your raw, unprocessed data files inside the `data/raw` folder.
   - The `data/processed` folder will be used to store results from exploratory data analysis (EDA) and processed datasets.

5. **Run the EDA notebook**  
   - Open the EDA notebook (e.g., `notebooks/eda.ipynb`) in Jupyter or VS Code.
   - Run the notebook to process the raw data. The processed outputs will be saved in the `data/processed` folder.

## Credit Scoring Business Understanding

The Basel II Accord places a strong emphasis on robust risk management and capital adequacy for banks, particularly through its Pillar 1 (Minimum Capital Requirements) and the Internal Ratings-Based (IRB) approach. This framework necessitates that banks accurately measure various risk parameters, including Probability of Default (PD), Loss Given Default (LGD), and Exposure at Default (EAD).

Here's how Basel II's emphasis on risk measurement influences the need for an interpretable and well-documented model:

1. Regulatory Scrutiny and Validation: Regulators require banks to demonstrate that their risk models are sound, reliable, and produce accurate risk estimates. This means models cannot be "black boxes." An interpretable model allows regulators (and internal auditors) to understand the logic behind the model's predictions, assess its assumptions, and validate its performance. Well-documented models provide the necessary audit trail, detailing data sources, model development choices, assumptions, limitations, and validation results.

2. Capital Allocation and Business Decisions: The calculated risk parameters directly impact a bank's capital requirements. If a model is not interpretable, it's difficult to understand why certain loans or portfolios are assigned higher capital charges, hindering strategic capital allocation. A well-understood model allows for better business decisions, such as setting appropriate interest rates, loan limits, and portfolio diversification strategies.

3. Risk Management and Control: An interpretable model facilitates effective risk management. If a model starts performing unexpectedly, interpretability helps identify the root cause – whether it's data quality issues, changes in borrower behavior, or model drift. Documentation ensures that model governance processes are followed, from initial development to ongoing monitoring.

4. Stakeholder Trust: For internal stakeholders (e.g., credit officers, senior management) and external stakeholders (e.g., investors), understanding how risk is being assessed builds trust. If decisions are made based on opaque models, it can erode confidence and lead to resistance in adopting model outputs.

5. Challenging Model Outputs: When a model's prediction seems counterintuitive for a specific case, an interpretable model allows credit analysts to investigate and potentially override the model's decision with justifiable reasons. This human oversight is crucial in complex lending scenarios.

### Why Creating a Proxy Variable is Necessary When Lacking a Direct "Default" Label, and Potential Business Risks of Predictions Based on this Proxy


1. Inconsistent Definition of Default: Different financial institutions or regulatory bodies might have varying definitions of what constitutes a "default." For example, it could be 90 days past due, bankruptcy, a specific legal action, or a combination of events. If a consistent, directly observable default flag isn't available in the historical data, a proxy is needed to unify the target variable.

2. Data Availability Challenges: Historical data might not have a clear "defaulted" status recorded for all accounts, especially for older portfolios or in cases where the primary focus was on repayment rather than explicit default flagging.

3. Early Warning Systems: Sometimes, the goal isn't just to predict a hard default, but to identify early signs of financial distress. In such cases, a proxy representing "severe delinquency," "restructuring," or "write-off" might be more relevant and timely than waiting for a formal default event.

4. Unusual Events/Low Default Rates: For certain portfolios (e.g., corporate lending to highly rated entities), actual default events might be extremely rare, making it difficult to build a robust model directly on observed defaults. A proxy representing "near-default" or "deterioration in credit quality" can provide more training data.

Key Trade-offs Between Simple, Interpretable Models (like Logistic Regression with WoE) Versus Complex, High-Performance Models (like Gradient Boosting) in a Regulated Financial Context
In a regulated financial context, the choice between model types often involves a careful balancing act between predictive power and transparency.

Simple, Interpretable Models (e.g., Logistic Regression with Weight of Evidence - WoE):

Advantages:

High Interpretability:

- Logistic Regression: Coefficients directly show the impact of each variable on the log-odds of default.

- WoE: Transforms categorical and continuous variables into a numerical scale that directly reflects the "strength of evidence" for or against default, making variable contributions highly intuitive and easy to explain to non-technical stakeholders (e.g., credit committee, regulators). The monotonic relationship often enforced with WoE also aligns with business intuition.

- Regulatory Acceptance: Historically, linear models like logistic regression have been the industry standard for credit risk modeling and are well-understood and accepted by regulators. Their simplicity makes them easier to validate and audit.

- Ease of Implementation and Monitoring: Simpler models are generally easier to build, deploy, and monitor for drift or performance deterioration.

- Robustness to Overfitting (potentially): With careful feature engineering (like WoE transformation and binning), these models can be less prone to overfitting, especially with smaller datasets.

- Transparent Decision Logic: It's straightforward to explain why a particular loan application was approved or rejected based on the model's outputs.

Disadvantages:

- Lower Predictive Performance (often): Simple models might not capture complex non-linear relationships or interactions between variables as effectively as more complex models, potentially leading to lower accuracy (e.g., lower Gini coefficient or AUC).

- Reliance on Feature Engineering: Achieving good performance often heavily relies on extensive and expert-driven feature engineering (like WoE transformation, which requires careful binning strategies).

- Assumptions: Logistic regression assumes a linear relationship between the transformed independent variables and the log-odds of the dependent variable, which might not always hold true.
